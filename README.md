### Local modifications
This fork was created to add a couple of features I wanted

Changes:
- Some adjustments to UI elements (personal preference).
- Added a "Branch Chance" display to show the current probability of branching at the next beat.
- bpm visualizer
- random stuff i liked

i dunno how to modify PWA or Android versions<br>
have fun

# The Forever Jukebox

![The Forever Jukebox logo](./tfj-logo.png)

The Forever Jukebox is a self-hosted, end-to-end system that analyzes audio,
serves the results via a lightweight API, and powers a refreshed Infinite
Jukebox-style web UI with branching playback and multiple visualizations. It
also includes an installable offline PWA and a native Android app for on-device
playback. It replaces reliance on the deprecated Spotify Audio Analysis engine
by generating similar beat/segment/section data locally.

## Structure

- `engine/` — The Forever Jukebox audio analysis engine (with optional calibration support).
- `api/` — REST API + worker that calls the engine.
- `web/` — Web UI.
- `pwa/` — Offline/local analysis PWA that can also export jukebox audio.
- `android/` — Native Android app.
- `schema.json` — JSON schema reference for analysis output.

## Quick Start

Prereqs: Python 3.11, npm (Node.js), ffmpeg.

All-in-one local dev:

```bash
./dev.sh
```

Local dev startup installs missing dependencies by default and does not check for latest versions each run. To force dependency updates locally, temporarily enable the update toggles in `dev.sh` and rerun it.

Then open the web UI at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Android (native app)

- Download: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/creightonlinza/forever-jukebox/releases/latest)
- Signature (SHA-256):

```bash
  B5:30:EB:FD:C1:7E:C2:D0:1A:2E:9A:9D:D9:DD:02:CA:5D:2F:E0:7A:E2:C6:E5:F8:45:E7:FF:41:FD:78:B4:4D
```

## Docker (production)

Build and run the container with Docker Compose (serves web UI + offline PWA + API).

Set required environment variables:

```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=...
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=...
export YOUTUBE_API_KEY=...
export ADMIN_KEY=...
export NTFY_TOPIC_KEY=...
export WORKER_COUNT=1
export MAX_TRACK_LENGTH=12
export ALLOW_USER_UPLOAD=false
export ALLOW_USER_YOUTUBE=false
export ALLOW_FAVORITES_SYNC=false
```

You can also put these values in a `.env` file (same directory as
`docker-compose.yml`) and Compose will load them automatically.

Run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Notes:

- `ENGINE_CONFIG` is optional and unused by default; set it only when you explicitly want to use calibration parameters.
- `MAX_TRACK_LENGTH` is optional (minutes) and limits both user-upload and YouTube analysis jobs by duration.
- Dependency updates (`yt-dlp`, `madmom-beats-lite`, `deno`) happen at image build/deploy time. Container startup does not perform network updates.
- To force-refresh externally sourced dependencies, run `docker compose build --no-cache` and then `docker compose up`.

Open:

- Web UI: `http://localhost:8000/`
- Offline PWA: `http://localhost:8000/offline/`

API routes are under `/api/*`. The Compose file uses a named Docker volume
(`storage`) to persist `/app/api/storage`.
